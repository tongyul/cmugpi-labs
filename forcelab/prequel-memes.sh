Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth $1 the $2? I thought not.
It's not a story the $3 would tell you. It's a $4 legend. Darth $1
was a Dark Lord of the $4, so powerful and so $2 he could use the Force
to influence the midichlorians to $5... He had such a knowledge of
the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from $6.
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to
be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was
losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he
taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice $7 him in
his sleep. Ironic. He could save others $8, but not himself."
